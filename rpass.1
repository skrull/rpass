.Nm rpass
.Nd strong password generator for humans
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl V
.Op Ar bitlen
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a strong password generator for human beings.
The generated passwords are shorter than Diceware which suits them better for
use on mobile devices, the command line or other environments where one has to
frequently type the password.
The passwords are case-insensitive so that there is no alternation between
keyboards on insert.
Blanks can be inserted at arbitrary places to enhance visual representation.
Furthermore, the passwords are both visually and phonetically unambiguous.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl V
Print the version of rpass.
.It Ar bitlen
Use a key space of the specified bit length, defaults to 40.
.El
.Pp
In order to determine the right
.Ar bitlen
three factors should be considered:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
the hashing mechanism used to store the password
.It
the time for which this password has to be secure
.It
the processing power of the adversary
.El
.Pp
The default
.Ar bitlen
of 40 bits relies on the following requirements: the password is stored using
.Xr bcrypt 3
with 2^10 rounds, it should only be secure for one year and the adversary
has no more than $25,000.00 to spend on brute forcing the password (as of 2019).
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Random password from the default key space:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ rpass
jikmus xuzjex
.Ed
.Pp
Random password from an 80 bit key space:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ rpass 80
jultar ramlap rinwun bemvuh
.Ed
.Pp
In order to calculate the required
.Ar bitlen
let's consider a scenario with the following requirements: the generated
password will be used for at most half a year and is stored using
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a million iterations.
Furthermore the adversary has $25,000.00 to spend.
According to
.Dq 8x Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti Hashcat Benchmarks
as of 2019 the adversary can try 15 million hashes per second on
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a thousand iterations.
This would be 15 thousand hashes per second on PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a million
iterations.
Hence the required key space is 15,000 * 3,600 * 24 * 183 * 2 = 38.8 bits.

.Sh BUGS
The phonetic ambiguity of the current set of mnemonics depends on the spoken
language and is currently optimized for the Dutch language.
